On the Home page, users are greeted with a welcome to the app. Selecting the "Let's go!" button will redirect users to the Exercises page.

On the Exercises page, users can view their current exercises, as well as add new ones. Exercises can be given a name, description, and select from six different categories. Once submitted, the new exercise will appear below previously existing ones. Exercises can be deleted by clicking the "delete" icon.

On the Workouts page, users can view their current workouts, as well as add new ones. Workouts can be given a name and description; once submitted, the new workouts will appear below previously existing ones. Workouts can be deleted by clicking the "delete" icon, and can be edited by clicking the "edit" icon. Editing allows users to add new exercises by selecting checkboxes for each desired exercise, as well as to remove exercises from a workout by unchecking them.
